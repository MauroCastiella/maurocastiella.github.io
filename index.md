# Mauro L. Castiella

Economist based in Buenos Aires. I earned a B.S. and an M.S. in Economics at Universidad Torcuato di Tella. My interests lie at the intersection of macroeconomics and development, with a focus on business cycles and the role of institutions and expectations. In the near future, I plan to pursue a PhD in Economics.
