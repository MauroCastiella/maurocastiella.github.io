## Working Papers

### **A General Equilibrium Model of Corruption**
[Download PDF](/A%20General%20Equilibrium%20Model%20of%20Corruption.pdf)

**Abstract:**  
This paper develops a dynamic general equilibrium model in which agents allocate time between productive labor, leisure, and corruption activities. The efficiency of corruption follows a stochastic process, generating endogenous cycles in aggregate output, labor supply, and misallocation. The model highlights how institutional quality and incentives shape the aggregate impact of corruption shocks.

### **Efectos de la Moneda en los Sesgos Cognitivos Asociados al Descuento Temporal**  
[Download PDF](/Undergrad_Thesis.pdf)

**Abstract:**  
This thesis studies how the denomination of money affects intertemporal decision-making and time-discounting biases. Using experimental evidence, the project shows that nominal framing influences patience, with implications for behavioral macroeconomics and policy design.

### **See it to Believe it: Experimental Evidence on Status Consumption Among the Youth**  
[Download PDF](/see-it.pdf)

**Summary:**  
As part of a research team at CAF, I contributed to the design, data processing, and analysis of a field experiment studying conspicuous consumption among adolescents. The study evaluates how visibility, peer effects, and social comparison shape spending decisions among low-income youth.

### **Difference-in-Differences When Units Are Substitutes: Evidence from Place-Based Policies**  
[Download PDF](/Place_Based_Montevideo.pdf)

**Summary:**  
I contributed to data work and empirical analysis for a paper showing that border DiD estimates of place-based policies can be biased when nearby neighborhoods are substitutes, because re-sorting spillovers contaminate control areas. In an application to Uruguay’s LVIS housing tax break in Montevideo, border designs can suggest near-zero incidence, while a structural model accounting for differential substitutability estimates an incidence of about 80%.

### **Upcoming: Urban Planning and Local Development: Evidence from Brazil's City Statute**
[Download PyGIS Code](/Metrics_Brazil_24.py)

**Summary**

Along with Guillermo Alves, we study the effects of Brazil’s 2001 City Statute, which required municipalities with at least 20,000 inhabitants to adopt a master plan, using a fuzzy regression-discontinuity design around the population cutoff. The analysis examines how the mandate affected local planning capacity, municipal finances, urban regulations, and long-run outcomes related to urban development, infrastructure provision, and the spatial footprint of cities measured with satellite data. To build these measures, I developed a Python/QGIS pipeline that iterates over municipalities, cleans and harmonizes geospatial inputs, extracts urban footprints from raster and vector layers, computes shape and fragmentation metrics (e.g., area, perimeter, dispersion, and distance-based measures), and exports a municipality-level panel that can be merged with administrative and socioeconomic data for the econometric analysis.
