[Download PDF](/A%20General%20Equilibrium%20Model%20of%20Corruption.pdf)

**Abstract:**  
This paper develops a dynamic general equilibrium model in which agents allocate time between productive labor, leisure, and corruption activities. The efficiency of corruption follows a stochastic process, generating endogenous cycles in aggregate output, labor supply, and misallocation. The model highlights how institutional quality and incentives shape the aggregate impact of corruption shocks.
